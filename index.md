# Unfamiliar Software

### welcome
You have reached the unfamiliar software blog. The goal of this blog is to write about... you guessed it... unfamiliar software! 

### tell me more
**what exactly do you write about here?** -- The blog will have posts that attempt to explain software tools, libraries, and features in general easy to digest terms.

**Are you some sort of an expert?** -- Nope! Well sort of! but definitely not really. To be more clear, I am a software developer. I make my living writing software for a company that sells that software to people to make their lives better. But I am not going to use this blog to write about that because I already spend so much of my life writing in those languages. I would rather spend my time learning about new technologies, languages, and tools.

**Should I read this blog?** -- I think so! My hope is that these blog posts will be useful for individuals who want to fill in thei mental picture of the field of computer sciece.

**How will this blog be written?** -- I believe that there is too much very detailed writing about coding. Blog posts or entire books about a very specific language are easy to come by. I want to write posts here that are enjoyable to read over a cup of coffee in the morning.
